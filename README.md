# Password Generator

### The main purpose of this assignment is to create a Password Generator that includes Uppercase Letter, Numbers, and Symbols to generate a difficult password. Securities nowaday is very important, and hackers are using Bruteforce attack. With this complex password generator, you do not have to worry about the password not being complex enough.

~~~ 
The Assignment was given to generate password App via Windows.Prompt/Windows.Alert/Windows.Confirm. 
But as a developer, I want to make the password Generator to be more User friendly. Therefore, 
Instead of using the Windows Prompt/Alert/Confirm, I decided to enhance my javascript skill and 
uses Checkbox, Range, and with Char Code to make the javascript easier to read.
This will make the App much more modern, and very simple to use.
