Securities nowaday is very important, and hacker are using Bruteforce attack, and with this complex password generator, you do not have to worry about the password not being complex enough.

~~~ 
The Assignment was given to generate password App via Windows.Prompt/Windows.Alert/Windows.Confirm. 
But as a developer, I want to make the password Generator to be more User friendly. Therefore, 
Instead of using the Windows Prompt/Alert/Confirm, I decided to enhance my javascript skill and 
uses Checkbox and Range instead. This will make it much more modern, and very simple to use.
